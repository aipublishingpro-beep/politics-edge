# Politics Edge

**Structural Analysis Platform for Kalshi Political Markets**

## What This Is

Politics Edge identifies mispriced political contracts by tracking structural realities — not polls or pundit opinions.

## Core Concepts

- **Constraint Tracking** — Filing deadlines, certifications, legal rulings
- **Path Counting** — Remaining viable paths to each outcome
- **Event Detection** — Court rulings, withdrawals, mapped to contracts
- **Market Lag Alerts** — When structure resolves but price hasn't moved

## Philosophy

We don't predict who wins. We track when outcomes become structurally locked before markets adjust.
